# CMPE131_food_ordering_system

This is a repository to hold all my deliverables of the food ordering system project of CMPE 131, Fall 2020 in San Jose State University.
The main purpose is to track my software process progress.
The final product will be a software allowing:
1. customer to order food, make payment and track food status
2. admin to update food categories and track payment
