# CMPE131_food_ordering_system

This is a repository to hold all my files and medias of the food ordering system ptototype project of CMPE 131, Fall 2020 in San Jose State University.

The main purpose of this online food ordering and management system is to replace the existing manual system by using automated software with the help of advanced information and technology systems so that the process can be faster and simpler. Besides, valuable data can also be stored, manipulated, and accessed easily for a longer period. Todayâ€™s way of ordering food mostly relies on manpower to enter orders to the ordering machine and collect payments manually. This is not only a waste of manpower but also a waste of time. The customers have no way to know the status of their ordered food, whether the food is being prepared or is on its way of delivery. The food ordering system allows the user to access the account with valid credentials. In the food ordering system, there are food items according to categories, cart, and online payment methods available for the users to surf, order and make a payment. Besides, users can track their orders with the food details. The admin of the food ordering system handles the functionalities like add new food items, edit or delete food items, enable or disable the food items according to season and availability. In addition, the admin would have the authority to view order details and update the delivery status of food. The payment transaction and user details are also viewable to admin.

The main purpose is to track my software process progress.
The final product will be a software allowing:
1. customer to order food, make payment and track food status
2. admin to update food categories and track payment

How to install:
1. Download the images folder and the FoodOrderingSystem.java file
2. Make sure the images are in a folder named image and the folder is in the same directory as the FoodOrderingSystem.java file
3. Open a terminal and change directory to the folder containing the image folder and FoodOrderingSystem.java file
4. Compile the program by
